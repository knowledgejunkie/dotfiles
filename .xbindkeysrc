# We need to update the stock Debian udev rule '95-keymaps.rules' by placing an
# override rule in /etc/udev/rules.d to remap the slider's >255 keycodes to
# keycodes <255 so that X receives them (we choose keycodes for F23 and F24)
#
# For testing/debugging key assignments, the following packages should be
# installed:
#
#   aptitude install x11-utils evtest
#
# For this .xbindkeysrc file to work, we need to install:
#
#   aptitude install xbindkeys xdotool
